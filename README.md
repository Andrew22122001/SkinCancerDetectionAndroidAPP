# 📱 Skin Cancer Detection Android App

An Android application that assists in early detection of skin cancer by analyzing dermoscopic images using advanced deep learning techniques trained on the HAM10000 dataset.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Upload or capture skin lesion images using your device camera
- On-device inference powered by pre-trained CNN models: ResNet152, VGG19, and DenseNet121
- Automatic classification into 7 skin lesion categories
- Robust ensemble-based decision making for better accuracy
- Lesion segmentation support enabled by Attention U-Net
- In-app educational content for user awareness

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Android** (Java/Kotlin)
- **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for efficient on-device inference
- **Python** (for model training and export)
- **OpenCV** for image pre-processing
- **Dataset:** HAM10000 (10,000+ high-resolution dermoscopic images)
